The app opened perfectly on a nexus 4, however I ran into some display issues with the Nexus 10. The navigation was easy to understand, however for the sake of consistency, I would like to have a similar button the child page to return you to the landing page. When the device was rotated landscape, the landing page became misaligned, however the child page was still laid out very well.
